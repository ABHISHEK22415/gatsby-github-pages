- Optimized SQL queries by using multi threaded procedures in Java application on TDV(Tibco Data Virtualization) increasing client query performance by 30%.
- Performed regression testing on TDV connectors to validate their stability and functionality after modifications or updates, ensuring cross-platform compatibility with JDBC application drivers for PostgreSQL and Spotfire.
- Implemented REST APIs to automate a suite of tasks on TDV server to minimize time. By this method we were able to identify and fix bad nodes in a cluster by testing the connection on Postman.
- Modified TDV server code, resulting in a 45% increase in memory management algorithm usage. This algorithm helps to increase efficiency for each SQL query runtime request present in a priority queue.
