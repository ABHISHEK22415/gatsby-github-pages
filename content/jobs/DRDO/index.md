- Analyzed requirements and objectives for non-uniform structure analysis, emphasizing stress and strain calculations.
- Collected and preprocessed data using ANSYS Workbench backend code (APDL), including cleaning, normalization, and transformation for machine learning algorithms.
- Employed machine learning techniques like K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to train predictive models on preprocessed data.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring effectiveness in predicting stress and strain.
- Integrated the trained model into software, developing a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and obtaining stress and strain predictions.
