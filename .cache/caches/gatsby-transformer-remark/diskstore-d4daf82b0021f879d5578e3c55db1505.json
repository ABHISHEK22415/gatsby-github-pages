By this method we were able to identify and fix bad nodes in a cluster by testing the connection on Postman.</li>\n<li>Modified TDV server code, resulting in a 45% increase in memory management algorithm usage. This algorithm helps to increase efficiency for each SQL query runtime request present in a priority queue.</li>\n</ul>"}
